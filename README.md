## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

#install 
yarn install

# start 
yarn dev



Create a web page using "Next.js". Integrate the api for getting the list of available posts and present all posts in your web page. You can use your past experience to make it nice and smooth.

Page Name:- posts.js
Api:- https://fakestoreapi.com/products/

Third-party Packages For Styling
You can only use this third-party packages/library for this Assignment
MUI (https://mui.com/)












Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
